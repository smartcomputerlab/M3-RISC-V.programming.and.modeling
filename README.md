# Project structure
+ Each sub-unit is created in its own directory
+ Each directory contains the modules used in this particular unit
+ Additionally it consists of testbenc used to test and debug those modules
+ The final processor implementation is in the directory - Processor
+ This uses all the relevant units and integrates them to provide working processor
