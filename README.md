##Project Structure:

    Each sub-unit that has been created has its own folder in root of the repository.
    This sub-unit folder comprises of the modules used in that particular unit.
    Additionally it consists of testbench and waveform used for testing and debugging those modules.
    The final processor implementation is in the folder called "Processor".
    This uses all the relevent units created individually and integrates them to give us our working processor.
